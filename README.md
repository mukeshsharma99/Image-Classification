# Image-Classification


Image classification refers to grouping the images based on similar features. It is a supervised
learning approach in which you are given a labeled dataset. In this particular problem, you need
to perform a binary classification of the given images. The binary classes identified are cats and
dogs. After extracting the suitable features from the images, design a binary classifier that
performs classification on the given data set. Also, evaluate the given classifier using all the  
evaluation metrics.
